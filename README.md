godel-setup.git
===============
Clone and run this on a new EC2 instance running Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS to
configure both the machine and your individual development environment as
follows:

```sh
cd $HOME
sudo apt-get install -y git
git clone https://github.com/SeboJBP/godel-setup.git
./godel-setup/setup.sh   
```

Note.
This is a modified version of the analogous file used in the Startup Engineering class in Coursera, modified for my need.
